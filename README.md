Simple game with CSS controls and "alternative" collision detection using getBoundingClientRect()

The concept was to try and create a game with the most basic features of javaScript, CSS an HTML. The navigation is pure CSS. No javascript. The collision detection is done only with getBoundingClientRect(). 

This project is meant as a practice to get the most out of webDev possibilities without using complex code.
